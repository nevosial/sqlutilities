//Update queries

UPDATE PROBSUMMARYM1 SET CLOSE_TIME=RESOLVED_TIME+ INTERVAL '7' DAY WHERE (PROBLEM_STATUS='CLOSED' AND CLOSE_TIME IS NULL AND RESOLVED_TIME IS NOT NULL)
UPDATE PROBSUMMARYM1 m1 SET RESOLVED_GROUP='ABCD' where m1."NUMBER" in ('KET1','KET2')

**Always follow an update statement with a commit.**

//Update strategy.
- Run update on the numbers acquired from the select.
- Run in batches of 1000.
- Backup : DB / only tickets backup via application in batches.

// Strategy for a bulk update.
1. Creating a temporary table.

create table TEMP_TABLE
(
number varchar(80),
resolved_time datetime,
resolution nvarchar(max),
cause_code varchar(80),
resolution_code varchar(80),
resolution1 nvarchar(max),
new_resolution nvarchar(max)
)

2. Load the data to be updated into this temporary table by using a .csv file.
(Can use 'Import Data' feature available in the SQL workbench)

3. Make sure that the data is loaded correctly by using a select statement.
(select * from TEMP_TABLE)

3. Run an update query to copy data from the TEMP_TABLE to the TABLE to be updated.
(key in mind the reference key ; in this case 'NUMBER')

update TABLE_NAME
set
flag = 'f',
status ='closed',
PROBLEM_STATUS = 'Closed',
sysmodtime = GETDATE(),
update_time = getdate(),
close_time = getdate(),
resolved_time = b.resolved_time,
resolution = b.new_resolution,
cause_code = b.cause_code,
resolution_code = b.resolution_code
assignment_group = b.group
from
TABLE_NAME a JOIN TEMP_TABLE b
ON
a.NUMBER = b.NUMBER


4. Following is the query to copy data from one to another table for oracle.

Tempgroup table contains | NUMB | GROUP |
Source table contains | NUMBER| field1 |....| fieldN |

//Below we are updating data into the main table from a temporary table called as tempgroup.

UPDATE TABLE_NAME p1
SET(p1.field_name) = (select b.resolvedgroup
from tempgroup b
where p1."NUMBER" = b.numb)
where exists( select 1 from tempgroup b where p1."NUMBER" = b.numb)

//ended
